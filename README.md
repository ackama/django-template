# Django Template Project

Expected Python Version: 3.12.x

## Purpose

This project is intended as:

- a kick-off point for projects
- an evolving codebase which implements our best practices at the time
- a place where we can document decisions that have been made about practices
    - e.g.: why X was picked, why Y was avoided (+ pros & cons)

## Contributing

If you have ideas for improvements, open a PR with your idea or propose it in the guild channel

Feature branches are encouraged, and merging should on consensus from guild

## Outstanding questions

Should this be open source? If so, which license?
