## Decision

<!---
The outcome this decision record is recording
--->

## Context
<!---
The background discussion the covers the context of the decision. It should answer
questions such as:

- What is the history of this decision?
- What is already in place?
- What other ideas were considered and rejected?
- Are there any non-obvious constraints that need to be taken into account
--->
## Implications
<!---
All technical decisions are compromises to some extent. The implications section is
intented to highlight those compromises and can also be used to record triggers for
situations in which the decision should be reconsidered.
