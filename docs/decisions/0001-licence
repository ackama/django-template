# 0001 Licence Adoption

- Date: 2023-11-09

## Decision

The 3-Clause BSD License - aligning it with Django itself.

## Context

Like the other Ackama templates, this one is publically available. As such the licencing 
should be made clear for anyone who wishes to use it. 

The Ruby on Rails template uses the MIT licence which aligns with the licence that Rails 
itself is released under. 

Django is released under the BSD-3-Clause licence. Both are similar and roughly equivalent.

## Implications

This does mean that Ackama is maintaining their templates under difference licences. But 
both a very permissive and functionally similar. Aligning with the underlying framework and
general preferences within the community feels like a worth while deviation.
