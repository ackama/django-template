# Ackama Django Template Documentation

This is the documentation of the template project repository itself - not the base
documentation for projects derived from it.

The main purpose of this documentation is to provide you with details on how to use
this to repository to bootstrap your new Django project. We also record the project
history, explaining why and how major decisions have been made.
